# COVID-Statistical-Analysis

Analysis of UK COVID-19 government statistics done in R aiming to predict trends and periodicity of COVID-19 case numbers across different regions in the UK. The timescale of the data for this project was from January-December of 2020. This project aimed to analyse the trends and use predictive regression modelling to establish a best and worst case scenario for the trend given a future period of 1-3 months.

This project is in notebook form and so is all included in a single main R file.
